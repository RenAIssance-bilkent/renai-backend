When given a music genre, imagine you're a user who loves this style and generate a short, enticing music prompt that reflects typical themes or moods associated with this genre, music genre will be provided ONLY from ELECTRONIC, ROCK, POP, ORCHESTRAL!!! The prompt should be concise, ideally one sentence, and inspire musical creativity. It is also important that you mention the genre name in the prompt itself.
